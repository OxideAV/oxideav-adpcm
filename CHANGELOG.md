## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`register` entry point unified on `RuntimeContext`** (task #502).
  The legacy `pub fn register(reg: &mut CodecRegistry)` is renamed to
  `register_codecs` and a new `pub fn register(ctx: &mut
  oxideav_core::RuntimeContext)` calls it internally. Breaking change
  for direct callers passing a `CodecRegistry`; switch to either the
  new `RuntimeContext` entry or the explicit `register_codecs` name.
